## Alpha CPU for Ghidra (Claes M Nyberg, 2019)
The reason for this project was to be able to read OpenVMS binaries more comfortable than using objdump. 
Christer Oberg implemented the binary loader and I did the Alpha CPU.

This implementaion support Linux GCC and OpenVMS DEC Compiler for DEC Alpha 21064A.
